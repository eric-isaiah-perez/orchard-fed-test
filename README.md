For this project I used jQuery and Bootstrap for my javascript and CSS framework. 

I also used the following libraries for this project:
1. AOS (Animate on Scroll) - https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/ - For animation and interactivity of the website.
2. Lightbox2 - https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/ - For modal/pop up when images are clicked.
3. Webpack - https://webpack.js.org/ - Build tool/Module bundler that I implement for this project.

To test the project please run `npm install` and `npm run build` in the terminal then open `index.html` using modern browsers (e.g. Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox)
